      The Cakewalk Bakery was a business that originated from a group of mothers in the early 1990s .
 The name 'Cakewalk' came from the fact that many of the workers there had to walk to their workplace usually from their husbands' workplace or from other locations , because they only had one car .
 The business started with funding only from the mothers and workers , but gradually more and more people came in and business was expanding .
 The business is still thriving to this day .
      Our bakery uses the finest local ingredients; eggs sourced from local farmers , flour derived from local wheat , and sugar from the sugar plants in Ontario .
  Our delicious pastries are baked fresh daily and goods from the other day are given to those who need them, however they hardly have leftovers here .
  We have updated the furniture and decor since 2016 and kept the style as rustic-modern ever since!
  Opening hours are from 8 : 00am to 8 : 00pm however, we're closed on Sundays . Deliveries are available in the cities that our bakeries are located in .
